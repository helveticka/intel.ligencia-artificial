# Intel·ligència Artificial

## Content
Here, there are three saved directories, each one storing a different kind of project about AI.

### P1: Search, by M. Ferrer & Harpo Joan
The first project is an introduction to the subject, in which diverse searching algorithm techniques are developed, such as Depth-First Uninformed Search and the A* algorithm. These algorithms are used and compared in a labyrinthine scenario.

### P2: Reinforcement Learning, by M. Ferrer & Harpo Joan
This directory stores a project about reinforcement learning. Its goal is to compare two algorithms: SARSA and Q-learning.

### P3: Machine Learning, by M.A. Llauger & Harpo Joan
The final and most extensive project is a complete Jupyter Notebook where we apply the following machine learning models: Perceptron, Logistic Regression, SVM, Decision Trees, and Random Forests. These models are executed and compared when applied to the same dataset, which is previously analyzed and cleaned.
